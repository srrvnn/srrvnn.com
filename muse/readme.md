**Problem**

Rare recordings, which capture the voices of our ancestors, are depleting at an alarmingly rapid rate.

**Goal**

Digitize these records to preserve them and make them electronically available to musicians, researchers and students of music.

**Our Solution**
* Easily discover the earliest recordings of Indian music
* Engage with it in a new way by “mixing” it with beats.
* Share the music you create; spreads awareness and re-kindles interest in vintage recordings.

**Future Work**
* Display insights about the track such as tempo, pitch, key, and suggest similar songs and artists.
* Display additional information about artists of historical significance that document the era
* Better “Spotify-like” browsing experience
